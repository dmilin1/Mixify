# Mixify

Mixify is a playlist merger that is used to find common songs between 2 or more users.

Ideal use cases are for users that disagree on music, but want to find music in common to listen to. Mixify automates this task.

Mixify is currently in an ongoing beta and is not intended for public use at this time. The demo can be launched by running the main method in the Sorter class.
